# 🚀 Next.js Data Fetching: SSR vs SSG vs ISR

## 📌 Introduction
Next.js provides multiple methods for **fetching data** to ensure the best performance and user experience. The three primary approaches are:

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** → Fetches data on every request.
- **SSG (Static Site Generation)** → Fetches data at build time only.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** → Fetches data at build time but allows periodic updates.

Each approach has **different use cases** depending on the type of data and performance requirements.

## 📍 Key Differences Between SSR, SSG, and ISR

### **1️⃣ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Data is fetched on every request**, meaning the page is rendered dynamically on the server.
- The request is **processed on the server before the page is sent to the client**.
- Ideal for **frequently updated data** such as **inventory levels, real-time news, or pages requiring user authentication**.
- **Main drawback**: Performance may be slower since the page **waits for data** before rendering.

✅ **Best for pages that require constantly updated data.**

---

### **2️⃣ Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **Data is fetched once at build time (`npm run build`)**, and the page is pre-rendered as **static HTML**.
- After deployment, the page is served **from the CDN**, making it **extremely fast**.
- Ideal for **content that does not change frequently**, such as **blogs, documentation, and landing pages**.
- **Main drawback**: Any updates to the data **will not appear until the site is rebuilt and redeployed**.

✅ **Best for static content that rarely changes.**

---

### **3️⃣ Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
- Similar to SSG but with **automatic periodic updates**.
- The page is **generated at build time**, but Next.js allows updates **at a specified interval (e.g., every 10 seconds)**.
- Ideal for **semi-dynamic content**, such as **product listings, news updates, or data that doesn’t need instant refresh**.
- **Advantage**: Provides the **performance benefits of SSG** while still allowing **automatic updates without redeploying**.

✅ **Best for content that needs occasional updates without rebuilding the whole site.**

## 🎯 **Comparison Summary**

| Feature | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** | **SSG (Static Site Generation)** | **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** |
|---------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **When is data fetched?** | On every request | At build time | At build time + periodic updates |
| **Performance** | Slower (fetching data for each request) | Fastest (pre-rendered HTML served from CDN) | Fast like SSG but with scheduled updates |
| **When is data updated?** | Every time the page loads | Only when the site is rebuilt | Automatically at set intervals (e.g., every 10s) |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic content (e.g., real-time inventory, user-specific data) | Static content (e.g., blogs, documentation) | Semi-dynamic content (e.g., product listings, news updates) |
| **Caching?** | No, always fetches new data | Yes, data is pre-stored | Yes, with periodic regeneration |

## 📌 How to Choose the Right Data Fetching Method?
- If your page **requires real-time data updates**, choose **SSR**.
- If your page **rarely changes and needs high performance**, choose **SSG**.
- If your page **needs to update periodically without redeployment**, choose **ISR**.

🚀 **With this knowledge, you can now select the best data fetching strategy for your Next.js project based on your application's needs!** 🔥
